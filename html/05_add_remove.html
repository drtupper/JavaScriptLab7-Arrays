    <h1>Page 5: Adding and Removing Items from an Array</h1>
    <p>Sometimes you need to add additional items to an array or remove some of the existing item.</p>
    <p>To add an item to an array, you can use <strong>unshift</strong> or <strong>push</strong>. Unshift adds an item
        to the beginning of the array and shifts all the other items to a higher index number. Push adds an item to the end of the array.  The syntax is:<br><strong>array_name.unshift();</strong><br><strong>array_name.push();</strong></p>
    <p>If you need to remove an item from an array, you can use shift or pop. Shift removes the first item in the array,
        and pop removes the last item in the array. The syntax is:<br>
        <strong>array_name.shift();</strong><br>
        <strong>array_name.pop();</strong>
    </p>
    <p>You can also add and remove items from an array using <strong>splice()</strong> and <strong>slice()</strong>.
        These methods are actually more flexible than shift, pop, unshift, and push because they allow you to add and
        remove the items from <strong>any</strong> location in the array.</p>
    <p>The syntax for <strong>splice(), which adds items to an array is:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>array_name.splice(2, 0, "item1", "item2");</strong></p>
    <p>Note that the first parameter, 2, is the position in the array where the items should be added, and the second
        parameter, 0, is how many items should be removed. The remaining parameters are the things that will be added to the array.  You can adjust these parameters to your needs.</p>
    <p>The syntax for <strong>slice()</strong>, which removes items from an array is:</p>
    <p><strong>array_name.slice(2);</strong></p>
    <p>Note that parameter, 2, is the position in the array before which the items should be removed. A new array will be returned that does not include any of the items with an index less than 2.</p>


    <p>1. Go to the 05_add_remove.html file and link the 05_add_remove.js file. You will know that you've done this
        correctly if you see the statement "05_add_remove.js linked" when you refresh this page</p>

    <p>2. Go to 05_add_remove.js file and follow instructions to practice adding and removing items from arrays.</p>
