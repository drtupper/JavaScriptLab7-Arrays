    <h1>Page 2: Accessing Array Items</h1>
    <p>How do you access items stored in the array once it is created?  The items can be accessed by typing the name of the array, followed immediately by their <strong>index number</strong> in square brackets.  Items are numbered in order, starting at 0.  The first item in the array is <strong>array_name[0]</strong></p>

<p>1.  Go to the 02_access.html file and link the 02_access.js file.  You will know that you've done this correctly if you see the statement "02_access.js linked" when you refresh this page</p>
